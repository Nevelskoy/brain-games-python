The package contains five simple mathematics quiz games:

- Even check `brain-even`
- Calculator `brain-calc`
- Greatest common divider `brain-gcd`
- Arithmetic progression `brain-progression`
- Prime number `brain-prime`

An analogue of the project, implemented on [Javascript](https://github.com/Nevelskoy/brain-games-js).

This is the first of four training projects on the Python Software Developer course on [Hexlet.io](https://ru.hexlet.io/professions/python/projects/49)
